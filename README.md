Linux installer for duelyst 32bit. Tested on ubuntu gnome 64 bit.

This script is made from another pre-existing script(now depricated) and I cannot find the source of it. If anyone finds the original, Please let me know I will link it here.

Requires npm, node, curl, wget

To install:
 do:

git clone https://github.com/mycroft91/duelyst_linux.git

cd duelyst_linux

sudo ./install_duelyst.sh

To add T2k5 scripts see the example in the install script. You NEED to change the path to reflect your installation directory.

You will find a parallel directory with the name Duelyst-linux-ia32 after the build which has the game executable. 
Please let me know if you face an issue with the installation
